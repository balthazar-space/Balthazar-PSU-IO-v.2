BalthazarPSU2

module BalthazarPSU2 is a combined battery charger, buck-boost coverter, stereo power amplifier and usb 2.0 hub. A somehow revised version of BalthazarPSU module, this one has an added usb 2.0 hub based on Microchip USB2514B which was much more readily available in Europe than GL3520 chip.
We also work on USB 3.0 - due to the chip shortage/availability - we now have to wait.

CERN Open Hardware Licence CERN-OHL W V.2.0 Version 2.0 of the CERN-OHL introduces three variants of the licence – strongly (S) reciprocal, weakly (W) reciprocal and permissive (P) – which aim to address specific constraints caused by different collaboration models currently used in open-hardware projects. The first two variants mean that if any product is made using an open hardware design, the design of that product, including any improvements or modifications, should be made available under the same licence as that of the original product. Permissive licences do not impose this condition.
